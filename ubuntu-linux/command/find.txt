Find
	- Syntax:
		$ find [-H] [-L] [-P] [path...] [expression]
	- The 3 options [-H] [-L] [-P] are not commonly seen but should at least be noted if only to realise that the -P option will be the default unless another option is specified:
		-H : Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments. 
		-L : Follow symbolic links.
		-P : Never follow symbolic links: the default option.
