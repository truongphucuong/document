		Lifecycle hooks (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html), like OnInit() work with Directives and Components. They do not work with other types, like a service in your case. From docs:

		A Component has a lifecycle managed by Angular itself. Angular creates it, renders it, creates and renders its children, checks it when its data-bound properties change, and destroys it before removing it from the DOM.

		Directive and component instances have a lifecycle as Angular creates, updates, and destroys them.
